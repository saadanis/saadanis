## Hello
I am [Saad Anis](https://saadanis.com), a ~~22~~ *23*-year-old developer based in ~~Doha, Qatar~~ *Glasgow, Scotland*. I very recently attained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Qatar University](https://qu.edu.qa) *and I'm currently doing my masters degree at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk)*. I try to focus my skills on iOS and web development.

I'm currently working on an [iOS application focused on flags using SwiftUI](https://github.com/saadanis/Vexillum).
